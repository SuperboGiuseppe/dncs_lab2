Design of Networks and Communication Systems Project A.Y. 2020-21 - University of Trento

Automating the deployment of network setups using vagrant

- To build a scripting/visual interface to pre-configure and run a network of VMs/containers and OpenVSwitches
- User interface could be a script that it converted in a Vagrantfile for running the network, or an HTTP interface
- Suggested software: Vagrant, OpenVSwitch, docker
- Proposer: Fabrizio Granelli (fabrizio.granelli@unitn.it)

# Modification By Uzair
- Two files are added namely "Vagrant" and "VagrantScriptCreatorInTextFormat".
- Two more files added namely "OSPFRoutingVag" and "OSPF Routing". One file contains a Python script to create the Vagrant file, the other file is just a JPG topology of the network.
